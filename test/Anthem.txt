Hear, mortals, the sacred cry:
Freedom, freedom, freedom!
Hear the sound of broken chains;
see the noble equality enthroned.

Already their dignified throne has been opened
the United Provinces of the South!
And the free in the world respond:
to the great people of Argentina, cheers!

to the great people of Argentina, cheers! 
And the free in the world respond:
to the great people of Argentina, cheers!
And the free in the world respond:

to the great people of Argentina, cheers!
May the laurels be eternal...
...that we were able to achieve!
...that we were able to achieve!

Crowned with glory let us live,
Or let us swear with glory to die!
Or let us swear with glory to die!
Or let us swear with glory to die!
